Determine "optimal parameters" for DBSCAN and Kmeans for clustering.

Optimal parameters is used losely here - it really refers to decent candidates to start with for clustering parameters.

Code is provided to calucate a decent estimate for the k vlaue for kmeans and also the eps parameter for DBSCAN
